    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Let's start with our raw ingredients:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>To begin this spooky recipe, preheat the oven to 180Â°C/360Â°F. Fry the minced onion until it's turned golden and smells nice. Add the garlic and continue to cook out for a further minute.</li>
        <li>Pour in beef stock and ketchup and reduce for a few minutes. Stir in sugar and seasonings and leave to cool.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, mix the breadcrumbs, parmesan and beef mince thoroughly with your hands. Add cooled ketchup mix and eggs and carry on mixing.</li>
        <li>Take the puff pastry and roll out to a large rectangle. Cut into strips - these are the bandages for your terrifying mummy! Argh!</li>
        <li>Lay the strips on a lined baking tray. Use your hands to shape the mince into a human shape and fold the bandages over, leaving a little bit of the head exposed - stick the olives in this bit for the eyes.</li>
        <li>Brush the pastry with egg and bake for 40-50 minutes until cooked through.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Now, the final touch:</p>
